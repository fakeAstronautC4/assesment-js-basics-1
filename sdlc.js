// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/


const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

let analisisOfRequirements = "In this step engineers focus on determining what the program must compute based on the client's needs and laid out a comprehensive development process"

let design = "After all the requirements are gathered software engineers design the blooprint of what the process is going to be, based of the analisis requirements"

let testingAndIntegration = "This step is where most of the code is written. Once all the departments are done with their part its all combined and tested for bugs"

let implementation = "Once all the bugs have been patched, the program is ready to be used and implemented on a server"

let maintain = "After the process is complete the program will eventually run into bugs, or the client might want to expand its functions. Engineers are responsible for debugging and carrying out any updates."
